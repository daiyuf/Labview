This system is a door access system written in LabVIEW, which includes voice recognition, student information management and 
other functions. The system matches the voice duration in the existing text with the input voice, and then determines whether
it is a student of this building; on the information management page, you can enter the account number and password to sort, 
query, delete and other functions for student information.
